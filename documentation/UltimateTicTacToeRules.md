The game is played on a board which is made of a 3 x 3 grid where each space contains a smaller 3 x 3 grid. Each player can place an X or an O, depending on whether they move first, in a legal position. The goal is to win grid spaces, which is done by placing three of their symbol in a row in any of the smaller grids. A player wins by winning three larger grid spaces assembled in a row. The rows may be horizontal, vertial, or diagonal. 

A legal position is determined by the last players move, and the state of the overall board. The first move may be played anywhere, in any of the larger grids. After that, the next player must play in the larger grid corresponding to the space in the smaller grid that the last player moved in. If the larger grid that would be played in is full, then the next player may play anywhere on the board.
